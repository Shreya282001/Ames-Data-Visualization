# Ames Housing Data Visualization

## Abstract or Overview
This project explores the Ames Housing dataset through visual analytics to uncover patterns and relationships among features affecting house prices. The primary goal is to gain insights into how various factors such as location, lot size, and number of rooms impact property values using interactive and static visualizations.

## Data Description
The dataset contains detailed information on residential homes in Ames, Iowa, including over 80 features such as:
- Lot size
- Year built
- Sale price
- Neighborhood
- Overall quality and condition
- Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and garages

This dataset is well-structured and serves as a modern alternative to the Boston Housing dataset for regression and EDA tasks.

## Algorithm Description
No machine learning models are used in this project. Instead, the focus is on data visualization techniques:
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps
- Distribution analysis using histograms and KDE plots
- Relationship plotting using scatterplots and boxplots
- Categorical feature breakdown via bar plots

These visual techniques help identify influential features and detect outliers or skewed distributions.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static plots
- Plotly for interactive charts
- Jupyter Notebook for iterative development

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries using:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

2. Open `Ames_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce all charts and analyses
